<!-- 1. This is another 'brick' in the wall of the html page,
        this is a different section of the website that shows
        the user the actual data, that's why there isn't 
         <form> and <button> tags but only <h1> headers and
         <p> paragraph tags, again you see {extends} and {block} -->

<!-- 2. This is what is shown on the data page, after the data is 
     confirmed and retrieved, look into the styles.css file and
     try to relate it to the divs, use my existing code as reference
     and minimal help - as in from ai, to understand concepts since
     you haven't perfected python, goodluck!-->
